## Overview

This challenge will really test layout skills. There are also areas that will require some JavaScript, such as the tabbed features section and the FAQ accordion.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

- Planned the layout structure with semantic HTML
- Designed mobile-first responsive styles using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Implemented tabbed navigation with vanilla JavaScript
- Built accordion component for FAQ section
- Tested across multiple device breakpoints
- Validated form inputs and displayed error messages

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to structure complex layouts using Tailwind effectively. Building the tabbed navigation taught me event delegation and DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript. Creating the accordion component improved my understanding of toggling states and managing multiple interactive elements. I also gained experience with form validation and displaying conditional error messages based on input state.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```tailwind
<p class="text-blue-950 bg-red-400">You have a new message!</p>
```

### Continued development

- Advanced responsive design patterns with CSS Grid for complex layouts
- Deeper mastery of vanilla JavaScript event handling and state management
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader testing)
- Performance optimization techniques and lazy loading implementations
- CSS animations and transitions for smoother user interactions
- Testing frameworks and writing unit tests for components
